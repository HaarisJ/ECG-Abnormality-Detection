# ECG-Abnormality-Detection

Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) may only occur occasionally, but their detection through electrocardiogram (ECG) is necessary for the early diagnosis of heart disease patients. Current solutions for prolonged ECG monitoring such as the Holter monitor, are inefficient due to poor electrode technology and the need for seven to 14 days of data being manually interpreted by a cardiologist.

This project involved developing a low-profile monitoring system that uses stretchable graphene electrodes and wirelessly classifies ECG readings in near real-time, while optimizing accuracy, signal quality, and ease-of-use.
