%
% Inputs:
%   ECG: single lead ECG signal
%   Fs: sampling rate of the ECG signal
%
% Outputs:
%   diffPeak: locations of the different R-peaks in ECG
%   checkMatrix: an array to check which conditions differ sufficiently
%                from the average QRS template
%            Col 1: orientation
%                2: height
%                3: width
%                4: ratio of preceding and succeeding peak interval
